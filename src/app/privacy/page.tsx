                      users under 18, or under the age of legal majority in
                      their country of residence, because such accounts are not
                      permitted. If we learn that an account was created by a
                      user under 18 or that age was misrepresented, we may
                      suspend or delete the account and associated data in
                      accordance with this Policy and applicable law.

                      measures (e.g., parental consent for younger users in
                      certain jurisdictions), we may request further
                      verification. Because accounts are limited to 18+,
                      parental consent is generally not required for our
                      Service; non‑logged‑in viewing does not involve collecting
